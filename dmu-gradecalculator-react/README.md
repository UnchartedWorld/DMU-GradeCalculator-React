# DMU Grade Calculator - React

DMU Grade Calculator is a React.js project that allows a user to input module marks and receive their overall module percentage, predicted grades and actual grades.

## How to build this project

Rather simple, requiring three steps.

1) Clone the repository.
2) Run `npm install` inside the project folder (this is the parent folder to src for reference).
3) Run `npm start` to have a localhost version run.

## How to contribute

Feel free to make pull requests if there's a feature you want to add, something that could be fixed or if there's something bothering. I do ask that whatever code you make a pull request with fits the following:

```
- Is it KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), or in other words as simple and straightforward as is reasonable?
- Is it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), or a function/method does one thing and can be used elsewhere, again where it's feasible.
- Are there decent comments/the code is self-commenting? Keep comments concise but useful.
```

So long as it fits those requirements, I'm likely to approve of your request, or at least heavily consider it. 

## Authors & Acknowledgements

This project utilises React UI Frameworks, such as [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/). In that regard, this project wouldn't possible without it.

I'd also like to thank a fellow student for creating an Excel spreadsheet that does the exact same functionality as this project. Without that as my baseline, this project would've taken much longer. I'll leave them anonymous for now, but if they wish to have their name listed in the future, I'll update this.

I also used [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploy-a-react-app-to-github-pages/)'s guide to allow this project to run on GitHub pages. Might be useful for some of you wanting to do the same.

## Project Status

In progress.


## License

This project uses the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license, much like Mantine itself.
